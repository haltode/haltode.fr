This is my personal website where I store infos on my projects, and also my old
articles (in French) about algorithms. I created some scripts so I could deal
with Markdown, and Jinja templates most of the time instead of pure HTML.

## Server

The website is hosted thanks to [Github Pages](https://pages.github.com/), in
another repository (because I wanted to use Github Pages with more flexibility,
with my own scripts/website structure).
