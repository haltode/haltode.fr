# NapNac

This is my personal website (in French) where I post articles about algorithms, and about my projects. All the articles are written in [Markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown), and then converted with a home made script (in [sh](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bourne_shell)) into HTML pages (using [pandoc](http://pandoc.org/)). The website is hosted on my raspberry pi (dotfiles are available [here](https://github.com/iTech-/Dotfiles_RPI)), which is running an [nginx](http://nginx.org/) server. I currently have a free domain name, but I will probably buy one later, and all the DNS config are handled by [CloudFlare](https://www.cloudflare.com/).
