        <p>This page lists my various personal trips over the years, with
friends or alone. It is a great way to look back on trips, store some
data about what city/countries I have visited, and keep in mind to do
more of these when possible!</p>
<h2 id="section">2019</h2>
<h3 id="south-east-asia">South East Asia</h3>
<p>My first real trip on my own. I had around 2 months before my student
exchange semester in South Korea, and since it would probably be the
only moment in my studies with such an opportunity to travel, I clearly
did not want to miss it.</p>
<p>The trip was one of the most intense (in every good way!) experience
I had abroad, I discovered a whole new way to travel with backpacking
and met <strong>so many</strong> people. The itinerary is a bit weird
mainly because of the various constraints I had in terms of time and
people traveling with me, but I would change very little given the
chance to do it all over again.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="//umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/south-east-asia-trip-2019_715341?scaleControl=false&miniMap=false&scrollWheelZoom=true&zoomControl=true&allowEdit=false&moreControl=true&searchControl=null&tilelayersControl=null&embedControl=null&datalayersControl=true&onLoadPanel=undefined&captionBar=false"></iframe>
<p>It definitely changed my view on traveling and living abroad.</p>
<p>Note: the South Korea part is missing quite a bit of cities/regions.
I have only included the main ones since I spent a few months there and
the country is small enough to travel very easily.</p>
<h3 id="bulgaria">Bulgaria</h3>
<p>Coming back from Asia, I had some time during the summer for a quick
10 days trip with a friend. We wanted to travel to Eastern Europe, and
picked one country none of use had ever visited, and not too big for the
duration of the trip. What a great idea to just hope on Google Maps and
pick a country to visit.</p>

<h2 id="section-1">2020</h2>
<p>At first, I knew this year would contain very little travelling
because of studies and work. It turns out I was both right and wrong,
since I did not travel at all, but mostly due to Covid-19:</p>
<ul>
<li>I planned at the beginning of the year to go to Finland to visit a
friend for a few days during one of my only break in April 2020, but it
got cancelled due to the sanitary crisis.</li>
<li>During the summer, I was supposed to work in the United Kingdom and
travel to New-York for an internship. I ended up working from home.</li>
</ul>
<p>Staying home was clearly the safest and most reasonable option.</p>
<p>I did get the opportunity to travel very briefly around France for
quick breaks with friends over the week-end: once in <a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lyon">Lyon</a> and another time in
<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bordeaux">Bordeaux</a>. Each
week-end was a refreshing break during this long and complex year!</p>
<h2 id="section-2">2021</h2>
<p>Same story as 2020, the studies and work was pretty intense (mostly
without breaks). I stayed in Paris most of the time, except for two
small pauses to move a bit around France with friends:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/La_Ciotat">La Ciotat</a>
(June, one week-end): to go diving and enjoy the beach/sun.</li>
<li><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tignes">Tignes</a> (August, a
week): for hiking and celebrating the end of our school year with the
rest of the teaching assistant team.</li>
</ul>
<p>This should be the last year where it is really hard for me to find
opportunities to travel (either because of studies or Covid-19 of
course). I hope to visit various places next year!</p>
<h2 id="section-3">2022</h2>
<p>This year turned out to be quite heavy on traveling! For my
internship, I worked in London and New-York. Living in London most of
the year, I went back to Paris a few times, visited Amsterdam over long
weekend, hopped on trains around UK, and at the end of my internship
planned bigger travels in Nordic countries.</p>
<h3 id="united-kingdom">United Kingdom</h3>
<p>In February, I moved to London for my 6 months end of studies
internship. I had some time during weekends and summer to explore the
country:</p>

<h3 id="iceland">Iceland</h3>
<p>At the end of my internship, I had to leave the UK and go back to
France to get my diploma before re-applying to get a long-term visa to
work in London again. This meant I had a couple of free months in
between, and as always I took this opportunity to travel. The first trip
was 3 weeks in Iceland around the entire island:</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="//umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/iceland-trip-2022_810991?scaleControl=false&miniMap=false&scrollWheelZoom=true&zoomControl=true&allowEdit=false&moreControl=true&searchControl=null&tilelayersControl=null&embedControl=null&datalayersControl=true&onLoadPanel=undefined&captionBar=false"></iframe>
<p>Iceland is a unique and incredible country. So much nature and places
to discover: volcanoes, glaciers, waterfalls, mountains, ... Even after
3 weeks I felt there was so much more to visit. I wish we could have
stayed a few more days in the north-west part of the country (but the
weather was horrible at the time so we mostly drove by). The itinerary
is quite unique because of everyone schedule for this trip. I added lots
of places we visited on the map, with a different layer for each week,
many anecdotes, and where we slept (in gold).</p>
<h3 id="finland">Finland</h3>
<p>After Iceland, I landed in Finland for a 10 days trip driving up
north with friends. We ended up taking a train overnight to get back to
Helsinki and later a flight to Paris. Beautiful forests and lakes,
especially at this time of the year (early September), great food and
plenty of good memories.</p>

<h2 id="section-4">2023</h2>
<p>I started the year with a work trip to Hong-Kong for 3 weeks, hiked a
lot around the islands. A Denmark trip over the summer to keep exploring
Nordic countries, and finally a combined New-York work trip with a
travel week in California during autumn.</p>
<h3 id="denmark">Denmark</h3>
<p>We did end up exploring a bit of Sweden in the South, but we will
have to come back for a longer vacation there.</p>
<iframe width="100%" height="500px" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen src="//umap.openstreetmap.fr/en/map/denmark-trip-2023_953658?scaleControl=false&miniMap=false&scrollWheelZoom=false&zoomControl=true&allowEdit=false&moreControl=true&searchControl=null&tilelayersControl=null&embedControl=null&datalayersControl=true&onLoadPanel=undefined&captionBar=false"></iframe>
<h3 id="california">California</h3>
<p>After a two weeks work trip to New-York, I spent a week in northern
California with a work friend. The time of the year was perfect for the
weather (late October), and Yosemite National Park was absolutely
stunning to visit. Half Dome hikes were closed unfortunately, so we will
have to come back another time for it. There's so much to see in
California alone that it's hard to choose what to do in only a week.</p>
