        <h2 id="publish-subscribe">Publish-subscribe</h2>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Publish%E2%80%93subscribe_pattern</a></p>
<p>Messaging pattern where senders (= publishers) categorize published
messages instead of sending them directly to receivers (= subscribers),
and where subscribers express interest in some categories and receive
messages without knowledge of publishers.</p>
<p>Pros:</p>
<ul>
<li>network scalability</li>
<li>loose coupling: publishers/subscribers do not need to know the
existence of one another (in the server/client paradigm a client cannot
post messages to the server while it is not running) =&gt; dynamic
network topology</li>
</ul>
<p>Cons:</p>
<ul>
<li>message delivery issues (side effect of loose coupling): need to
design the pub/sub system carefully to provide stronger system
properties that a particular application might require</li>
</ul>
<p>Many pub/sub systems use a <strong>message broker</strong> as an
intermediate.</p>
<p>Examples of pub/sub systems: news, atom, rss.</p>
<h2 id="message-broker">Message broker</h2>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_broker</a></p>
<p>Intermediate program that translates a message from the sender's
protocol to the messaging protocol of the receiver. The purpose is to
minimize the mutual awareness that applications should have of each
other to exchange messages.</p>
<p>Multiple uses of message broker: route messages to one or more
destinations, transform messages into alternatives representation,
perform message aggregation/decomposition, respond to events/errors,
etc.</p>
<p>Examples of message brokers: apache kafka, rabbitmq, redis.</p>
<h2 id="message-queue">Message queue</h2>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Message_queue</a></p>
<p>Paradigm used for inter-process communication (IPC) or inter-thread
communication within the same process. Sibling of the pub/sub
pattern.</p>
<p>Provide an asynchronous communication protocol (ie: the sender and
receiver do not need to interact with the message queue at the same
time). Messages placed on the queue are stored until the recipient
retrieves them.</p>
<p>Usage: a sysadmin setup the message queueing software and defines a
named message queue. An application listens for messages in the queue,
while other applications may transfer messages to this queue. Many
options to consider:</p>
<ul>
<li>durability: messages can be kept in memory, on disk, or committed to
a database</li>
<li>security: which applications can read/write to the queue?</li>
<li>message purging: do you need a lifetime limit?</li>
<li>message filtering: a subscriber may only need to see some specific
messages</li>
<li>delivery policy: do you need to guarantee delivery?</li>
<li>etc.</li>
</ul>
<p>Examples of message queue: celery, rabbitmq, redis, zeromq.</p>
<h2 id="acid-atomicity-consistency-isolation-durability">ACID
(atomicity, consistency, isolation, durability)</h2>
<p><a
href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science)">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ACID_(computer_science)</a></p>
<p>Set of properties of database transactions (often composed of
multiple statements) intended to guarantee validity even in the event of
errors, power failures, etc.</p>
<h3 id="atomicity">Atomicity</h3>
<p>Guarantees that each transaction is treated as a single unit (which
either succeeds completely or fails completely). If any statements
constituting a transaction fails to complete, the entire transaction
fails and the database is left unchanged (even in case of power failure,
errors, crashes, etc.).</p>
<p>Implementation: read-copy update (keep a copy of the data before any
changes occurred), journaling (keeps track of changes not yet committed
by recording the intentions into a journal), etc.</p>
<h3 id="concistency">Concistency</h3>
<p>Ensures that a transaction can only bring the database from one valid
state to another (maintaining database invariants).</p>
<h3 id="isolation">Isolation</h3>
<p>Ensures that concurrent execution of transactions leaves the database
in the same state as if the transactions were executed sequentially.</p>
<p>Implementation: locks</p>
<h3 id="durability">Durability</h3>
<p>Guarantees that once a transaction is committed it will remain so
even in case of system failure (eg: power outage, crash, etc.).</p>
<p>Implementation: store in non-volatile memory.</p>
