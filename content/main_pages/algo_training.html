            <p><strong>January-February</strong>: Not a lot of free time to train, especially with the start of Prologin's regional events and my first year school project. I also want to try another approach to my training, since until now I was basically trying to compete in as much contests as possible but this has a huge drawback: I don't have too much time to upsolve many problems afterwards. Instead, I will now only compete once a week at most, and the rest of the time will be dedicated to upsolving harder problems. I would also like to have at least 2h of training per day.</p>
