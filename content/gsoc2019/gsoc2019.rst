During the Google Summer of Code 2019, I will work with `Software Heritage
<https://www.softwareheritage.org/>`_: an ambitious research project whose goal
is to collect, preserve, and share the whole publicly accessible Free/Open
Source Software (FOSS) source code.

My mentors are: `Stefano Zacchiroli <https://upsilon.cc/~zack/>`_ and `Antoine
Pietri <https://koin.fr/>`_.

Subject

The **`Software Heritage data model
<https://docs.softwareheritage.org/devel/swh-model/data-model.html>`_** is a big
`Merkle DAG <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merkle_tree>`_  made of nodes like
revisions, releases, directories, etc. It is a very big graph, with ~17 B nodes
and ~160 B edges, which makes it hard to fit in memory using naive approaches.

Graph compression techniques have been successfully used to compress the Web
graph (which is slightly larger than the Software Heritage one) and make it fit
in memory. The goal of this GSoC is review existing graph compression techniques
and apply the most appropriate one to the Software Heritage case, enabling
in-memory processing of its Merkle DAG.
