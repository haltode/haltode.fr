### February 2018

- Team related
    - Train for Google Hash Code 2018
    - Find sponsors for ACM-ICPC Training Bootcamp 2018
- Try new training approach (mid February)
- Contribute to Prologin regional events
- Continue to setup the algorithmic assocation

**January-February**: Not a lot of free time to train, especially with the start of Prologin's regional events and my first year school project. I also want to try another approach to my training, since until now I was basically trying to compete in as much contests as possible but this has a huge drawback: I don't have too much time to upsolve many problems afterwards. Instead, I will now only compete once a week at most, and the rest of the time will be dedicated to upsolving harder problems. I would also like to have at least 2h of training per day.

### January 2018

- Truly try to work harder in general (I won't have much time this month for algorithmic training)
- Each week, do one USACO (gold division) contest + upsolving
- Maintain expert title on Codeforces once reached
- Maintain dark blue color on CS Academy once reached
- Create an association about competitive programming inside my school
- Create the last needed exercises for Prologin upcoming regional events

### December 2017

- Work on DP problems [[not_yet]]
    - Did some, but spend most of my time upsolving rather than focusing exclusively on DP
- Work on geometry problems
    - I realised that geometry problems are not a priority, at my level most of them only require basic geometry knowledge which I already have
- Start an association about competitive programming/algorithms inside my school [[not_yet]]
    - We made some progress, but with vacations it was hard to set it up
- Organize regular team trainings on our own
- Create more exercises for Prologin upcoming regional events [[done]]

### November 2017

- SWERC 2017 [[done]]
- WCPS 2017 [[done]]
- Focus on DP problems [[not_yet]]
	- I did a few exercises but I could have done more
- Create exercises for Prologin upcoming regional events [[done]]

### October 2017

- Form an ACM team and attend ACM team training each week [[done]]
	- First team training on 10/21
- Codeforces rating > 1525 [[failed]]
	- Focusing on rating is not a good idea on short term + Overestimated rating increase
- CSAcademy rating > 1600 [[failed]]
	- Same as above + CSA strengthened rating system by the end of October
- Create exercises for Prologin upcoming edition [[done]]

### September 2017

- Get into algorithms again by joining max. amount of algorithms contests/training [[done]]
	- Joined Prologin
	- Started goind to ACM training every week
	- Attended "Club Algo ENS" whenever I could
