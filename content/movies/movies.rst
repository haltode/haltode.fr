I always had a deep attachment to cinematography, thus I spend quite some time
watching various movies, reading critics and reviews, listening to cinema
related podcast, ... Most of what I watch comes from:

- Movie theaters (because nothing beats this experience).
- Subscription based online platforms: `Netflix <https://www.netflix.com/>`_,
  `LaCinetek <https://www.lacinetek.com/>`_, `Shadowz
  <https://www.shadowz.fr/>`_.

I try to keep track of every movie I have watched:

- `2023 </movies/2023.html>`_
- `2022 </movies/2022.html>`_
- `2021 </movies/2021.html>`_
- `2020 </movies/2020.html>`_
- `2019 </movies/2019.html>`_

I started doing this at the end of 2021, so before that date you can expect many
movies to be missing.
