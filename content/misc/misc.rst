Movies
------

I **love** movies and everything around them (reviews, analysis, debates, ...).
Most of what I watch comes from:

- Movie theaters (because nothing beats this unique experience).
- Subscription based online platforms: `Netflix <https://www.netflix.com/>`_,
  `LaCinetek <https://www.lacinetek.com/>`_, `Shadowz
  <https://www.shadowz.fr/>`_.

I tried to list every movies I watched over the last few years, but I obviously
missed a ton:

- `2021 </movies/2021.html>`_
