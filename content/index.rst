I am Thibault Allançon, a second year French student at
`EPITA <http://www.epita.fr/>`__ (a computer science school near Paris).
I am deeply interested in **programming** and **algorithms**. I mainly
code in C, C++, Python, Java, Rust and Caml.

Projects
~~~~~~~~

Some of my favorite personal projects:

-  `gitrs <https://github.com/haltode/gitrs>`__: a re-implementation of
   the git version control system in Rust.
-  `yaos <https://github.com/haltode/yaos>`__: a simple and small x86
   operating system in C and asm.
-  `prologin2018 <https://github.com/prologin/prologin2018>`__: rules in
   C++ of the game used for the Prologin 2018 finals.
-  `mlai <https://github.com/haltode/mlai>`__: implementation of various
   machine learning algorithms (neural network, regression, svm,
   k-means).

School projects:

-  `OCR <https://github.com/haltode/OCR>`__: Optical character
   recognition software written in C.
-  `Pacification <https://github.com/haltode/Pacification>`__:
   civilization-like 3D multiplayer game made with C#/Unity.

I do have some oldest/silliest projects hosted on my GitHub page:
`lispy <https://github.com/haltode/lispy>`__,
`pornote <https://github.com/haltode/pornote>`__,
`nandtotetris <https://github.com/haltode/NandToTetris>`__, ...

Google Summer of Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 2019, I worked with `Software Heritage <https://www.softwareheritage.org/>`_
on a Google Summer of Code project: `Graph compression on the development
history of software </gsoc2019.html>`_. It was an incredible summer: super
interesting project, and awesome mentors!

Associations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I greatly enjoy contributing to computer science related associations,
such as `Prologin <https://prologin.org/>`__ and
`France-IOI <http://www.france-ioi.org/>`__. Concerning Prologin, I was
finalist in 2015 and 2016 of their national contest, and joined in as an
organizer in 2017. Same story goes for France-IOI where I took part in
the Algoréa contest final in 2014 and national selection in 2015, before
helping out as a trainer in 2018.

Articles
~~~~~~~~

A few years ago I wrote more than 30 articles (in French) about
algorithms. I learned **a lot**, but writing is not a priority for me
anymore. Most of the articles are pretty basic (data structures,
sorting, encryption, searching), but the latest are definitely more
interesting such as the ones on `artificial
intelligence <algo/ia/apprentissage_artificiel/introduction.html>`__ or
optimization methods like `dynamic
programming </algo/general/approche/dynamique.html>`__.

You can still find the full list of articles `here </articles.html>`__.
