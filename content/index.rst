I am Thibault Allançon, a firth year French student at `EPITA
<http://www.epita.fr/>`__ (a computer science school near Paris).  I am deeply
interested in **programming** and **algorithms**. I mainly code in C, C++,
Python, Java, Rust and OCaml.

Projects
~~~~~~~~

Some of my favorite personal projects:

-  `gitrs <https://github.com/haltode/gitrs>`__: a re-implementation of
   the git version control system in Rust.
-  `yaos <https://github.com/haltode/yaos>`__: a simple and small x86
   operating system in C and asm.
-  `prologin2018 <https://github.com/prologin/prologin2018>`__: rules in
   C++ of the game used for the Prologin 2018 finals.
-  `mlai <https://github.com/haltode/mlai>`__: implementation of various
   machine learning algorithms (neural network, regression, svm,
   k-means).
-  `raytracer <https://github.com/haltode/raytracer>`__: an experimental
   LaTeX-only raytracer made for fun.

School projects:

-  Chess engine and AI in C++ (3rd year project).
-  Re-implementation of UNIX utility tools in C: ``find``, ``make``, ``malloc``
   and a POSIX shell (3rd year projects).
-  `OCR <https://github.com/haltode/OCR>`__: Optical character
   recognition software written in C (2nd year project).
-  `Pacification <https://github.com/haltode/Pacification>`__:
   civilization-like 3D multiplayer game made with C#/Unity (1st year project).

Google Summer of Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In 2019, I worked with `Software Heritage <https://www.softwareheritage.org/>`_
on a Google Summer of Code project: `Graph compression on the development
history of software </gsoc2019.html>`_. It was an incredible summer: super
interesting project and awesome mentors!

Associations
~~~~~~~~~~~~

I greatly enjoy contributing to computer science related associations, such as
`Prologin <https://prologin.org/>`__, `Girls Can Code!
<https://girlscancode.fr/>`__ and `France-IOI <http://www.france-ioi.org/>`__.
Concerning Prologin, I was finalist in 2015 and 2016 of their national contest,
and joined in as an organizer in 2017. Same story goes for France-IOI where I
took part in the Algoréa contest final in 2014 and national selection in 2015,
before helping out a few times in 2018.

Teaching computer science related topics to others has always been a keen
interest of mine, and at EPITA I had the opportunity to become a teaching
assistant for three years. The role consisted of giving courses, talks and
organizing projects in order to teach students C, UNIX, C++, Java, Caml and C#.

Articles
~~~~~~~~

A few years ago I wrote more than 30 articles (in French) about
algorithms. I learned **a lot**, but writing is not a priority for me
anymore. Most of the articles are pretty basic (data structures,
sorting, encryption, searching), but the latest are definitely more
interesting such as the ones on `artificial
intelligence <algo/ia/apprentissage_artificiel/introduction.html>`__ or
optimization methods like `dynamic
programming </algo/general/approche/dynamique.html>`__.

You can still find the full list of articles `here </articles.html>`__.
